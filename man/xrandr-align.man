.SH NAME
xrandr-align -- utility to keep the proper alignment between the
screen and an X input device

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xrandr-align [OPTIONS] [FUNCTION] [FUNCTION-OPTIONS]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The xrandr-align is a utility to keep the proper alignment between the
screen and an X input device. The utility works in both ways. First, it
can dynamically align an input device (touchscreen) to correspond the
varying orientation of the screen. Second, it can dynamically align
the screen to correspond the varying spacial orientation of the
display (handheld device). In addition it can list available input
devices and screen outputs.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B -v | --verbose
Turns on the verbose output mode.

.SH FUNCTIONS
.TP 8
.B version
Prints out the program version and the versions of XInput and XRandR
extensions available on the running X server. This function does not
require any additional options.
.PP
.TP 8
.B list-input [--short | --long] [\fIname-or-ID\fP]
If no argument is given lists all available input devices. If an
argument is given, shows all the features of the device with the given
\fIname or ID\fP.
If --long is provided, the output includes detailed information about
the capabilities of each devices. Otherwise, or if --short is
provided, only the device names and some minimal information is
listed.
.PP
.TP 8
.B list-output [--screen=\fIinteger\fP]
If no argument is given lists all available screen outputs. Optionally
the \fIscreen\fP number can be specified.
.PP
.TP 8
.B align [--input=\fIname-or-ID\fP] [--screen=\fIinteger\fP] [--output=\fIname-or-ID\fP]
The default function. It is called when no function name is given. It
queries the current screen configuration and applies the current
coordinate transformation to the input device. If no options are given
then the Core Pointer and the Primary Output (or the first available
output) is used in correspondence. The name or the ID of the input
device can be specified with the \fIinput\fP option. The name or ID of the
output can explicitly specified with the \fIoutput\fP option. For a
multiple screen configuration the output selection can be directed by
specifying the \fIscreen\fP number.
.PP
.TP 8
.B monitor [--input=\fIname-or-ID\fP] [--screen=\fIinteger\fP] [--output=\fIname-or-ID\fP]
Listens to the screen (CRTC, output) change events from RandR and
applies each coordinate transformation to the input device. If no
options are given then the Core Pointer and the Primary Output (or the
first available output) is used in correspondence. The name or the ID
of the input device can be specified with the \fIinput\fP option. The name or
ID of the output can explicitly specified with the \fIoutput\fP
option. For a multiple screen configuration the output selection can
be directed by specifying the \fIscreen\fP number.
.PP
.TP 8
.B gravitate [--input=\fIname-or-ID\fP] [--screen=\fIinteger\fP] [--ratio=\fIfloat\fP] [--threshold=\fIfloat\fP]
Listens to the events from the given input device which should be a
gravity sensor (accelerometer) and rotates the screen in accordance
with the varying spacial orientation of the device. The gravity sensor
data is analysed with the use of \fIratio\fP and \fIthreshold\fP
parameters. The first defines the minimum ratio between horizontal and
vertical pitch in order to select the prevalent one and equals 2.0 by
default. The second defines the minimal pitch value to consider in
relation to the axis value range and equals 0.12 by default.
The name or the ID of the input device should be specified with the
\fIinput\fP option. Optionally the \fIscreen\fP number can be specified.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The program uses the \fBDISPLAY\fP environment variable specifying the
X display to connect.
