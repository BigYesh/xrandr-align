			xrandr-align
			============

Overview
========

The xrandr-align is a utility to align an X input device in accordance
with the screen rotation, panning and scale parameters controlled by
the X RandR extension. In addition the utility can list available
input devices and screen outputs.

The `monitor' command is used to apply the transformations dynamically
listening to the events from the RandR extension.

Requirements
============

The program uses the X11 headers and particularly the XInput and
Xrandr headers. Based on the  xinput utility it supports the new
device types added in Xserver 1.4 (Xorg 7.3), the headers must be from
that version or newer.

The main requiremen for compilation process is a working ANSI C
compiler. However, the GNU Autotools and the `make' program would be a
good addition making the build process much easier.

Building and Installation
=========================

xrandr-align uses autotools so the usual pattern applies:

autoreconf -fi
./configure
make
make install
